### Procedure

- Connect the MCU to the motor driver and the stepper motor.

- Find out the number of steps required to rotate 1 revolution using Full-steppping.

- Then, rotate the stepper motor 10 revolutions with 2 rpm. Measure if the motor rotates one revolution per second.

- Repeat the above process in the opposite direction.

- Increase and decrease the speed of the motor as fast as it can rotate to find the maximum and minimum speed of the motor.

- Apply the half-stepping and repeat the above.

### Requirement

 The contents of the written FSM graph above were implemented into code by creating a structure to implement the Full & Half stepping sequence.

```c
//FULL stepping sequence  - FSM
typedef struct {
	uint8_t out;
  	uint32_t next[2];
} State_full_t;

State_full_t FSM_full[4] = {  
 	{0b1100,{S1,S3}}, 
 	{0b0110,{S2,S0}},
 	{0b0011,{S3,S1}},
 	{0b1001,{S0,S2}},
};

//HALF stepping sequence
typedef struct {
	uint8_t out;
  	uint32_t next[2];
} State_half_t;

State_half_t FSM_half[8] = { 
 	{0b1000,{S1,S7}},
	{0b1100,{S2,S0}},
	{0b0100,{S3,S1}},
	{0b0110,{S4,S2}},
	{0b0010,{S5,S3}},
	{0b0011,{S6,S4}},
	{0b0001,{S7,S5}},
	{0b1001,{S0,S6}},
};
```



### Discussion

1. Find out the trapezoid-shape velocity profile for a stepper motor. When is this profile necessary?

   >  The trapezoidal-shaped velocity profile of a stepper motor is primarily used when the speed increases or decreases while the acceleration and deceleration are maintained constant. This aids in smoothly accelerating and decelerating the motor, hence it is necessary in applications that require high precision and smooth motion.
   >
   > The trapezoidal speed profile can be divided into three sections:
   >
   > Acceleration section: The stepper motor increases its speed at a constant acceleration. This section continues until the speed reaches its maximum. 
   >
   > Constant speed section: The motor operates steadily at maximum speed. This section continues until the motor begins to decelerate. 
   >
   > Deceleration section: The motor reduces its speed at a constant deceleration. This section ends when the speed reaches 0. 
   >
   > This type of speed profile is necessary in high-speed, high-precision applications, and also when you want to avoid actions that start or stop abruptly. If the acceleration or deceleration is too high, the motor may unnecessarily overheat, and the lifespan of the parts may be shortened.

2. How would you change the code more efficiently for micro-stepping control? You donâ€™t have to code this but need to explain your strategy.

> Selection of interpolation algorithm: An interpolation algorithm can be selected to improve microstep control. For example, smoother motor operation can be achieved using linear interpolation, sine curve interpolation, or other advanced algorithms. 
>
> Adjustment of step size: In microstep control, the accuracy of the motor can be increased by adjusting the size of the step. By adjusting the size of the step smaller, the control of the motor position can be made more sophisticated. 
>
> Change of step angle: Generally, the motor steps in units of 1.8 degrees. However, the precision of the motor can be improved by setting the step to a smaller angle than this. For example, more sophisticated control can be achieved by setting the step in units of 0.9 degrees.





### Code

**LAB_Stepper Motor.c**

 The execution of the program is initiated by the `main()` function. The `setup()` function is called to perform initial settings, followed by the call to the `Stepper_step()` function that rotates the stepper motor by a certain number of steps. Subsequently, it enters an infinite loop with `while(1)`, where the operation of the stepper motor is controlled depending on the value of the flag variable. 

 If the flag is 1, the Stepper_stop() function is called to stop the motor, otherwise, the `Stepper_step()` function is called to rotate the motor. The setup() function performs the initial settings of the system. In this function, clock settings, SysTick timer initialization, GPIO and external interrupt settings, stepper motor initialization, stepper motor speed settings, etc., are carried out. 

 The` EXTI15_10_IRQHandler()` function is an external interrupt handler. This function is called when a falling edge is detected at the GPIO pin, toggles the value of the flag variable, and calls the `Stepper_stop()` function to stop the motor. Afterwards, the interrupt is cleared to prepare for the next interrupt.

```c
#include "stm32f411xe.h"
#include "math.h"
#include "ecGPIO.h"
#include "ecEXTI.h"
#include "ecRCC.h"
#include "ecTIM.h"
#include "ecSysTIck.h"
#include "ecStepper.h"


#define BUTTON_PIN 13


void setup(void);
void EXTI15_10_IRQHandler(void);

uint32_t flag = 0;

int main(void){
	
	setup();
	
	Stepper_step(2048, 1, HALF); //steps/rev = 64x32
	
	while(1){
		if(flag == 1){
			Stepper_stop();
		}		
		else{
			Stepper_step(2048, 1, HALF);		
		} 		 						
	}
}


void setup(){

	RCC_PLL_init(); 
	SysTick_init();
	
	GPIO_init(GPIOC, BUTTON_PIN, INPUT);
	EXTI_init(GPIOC, BUTTON_PIN, FALL, 0);
	
	Stepper_init(GPIOB, 10, GPIOB, 4, GPIOB, 5, GPIOB, 3);
	Stepper_setSpeed(2);
}

void EXTI15_10_IRQHandler(void) {
   if (is_pending_EXTI(BUTTON_PIN)) {
			flag ^= 1;
			Stepper_stop();
			clear_pending_EXTI(BUTTON_PIN);
   }
} 
```



### Results

 As can be seen in the video, the motor operates normally at speeds of 1 to 3. It was also confirmed that when the button is pressed, an interrupt occurs, and the motor stops. 

 However, a problem occurs at speeds of 4 and above, where the motor's vibrations are transmitted, but it does not move. Given that the same logic algorithm applies up to speed 3 but not beyond, it seems to be a hardware limitation. Additionally, it was observed that when the motor is supposed to rotate in the opposite direction of the clock, only the motor's vibrations are transmitted and it does not rotate. Since the sequence in the original FSM is simply reversed, it is speculated that there is no issue with the code, and it is suspected that this could also be a hardware issue.

## Troubleshooting

 When the initial code was completed, an issue arose where the motor did not stop even when a button interrupt occurred. The `Stepper_step` function operates in a blocking manner, which hinders the execution of other codes while the motor is rotating for the given number of steps. This was why the motor did not stop even when a button interrupt occurred.

 To resolve this, the `Stepper_step` function was modified to operate in a non-blocking manner. By doing this, the `Stepper_step_non_blocking` function performs the given step when it's time to do so and immediately returns if not. This does not interfere with the execution of other codes.

 Two static variables, `state` and `last_step_time`, are used. `State` records the current state of the stepper motor, and `last_step_time` records the time when the last step was performed. `Current_time` represents the current time, which is obtained using the `SysTick_val` function. The function only performs a step when the difference between `current_time` and `last_step_time` is equal to or greater than `step_delay`. This maintains a regular interval between each step. When performing a step, `steps` is first assigned to `myStepper._step_num`, and then a step is performed as long as `myStepper._step_num` is greater than 0. `MyStepper._step_num` is decremented by 1 each time a step is performed.

```c
void Stepper_step(uint32_t steps, uint32_t direction, uint32_t mode){
    static uint32_t state = 0;
    static uint32_t last_step_time = 0;
    uint32_t current_time = SysTick_val(); 

    if ((current_time - last_step_time) >= step_delay){
        last_step_time = current_time; 
        myStepper._step_num = steps;

        if(myStepper._step_num > 0){ // run for step size
            if (mode == FULL)                                            
                state = FSM_full[state].next[direction]; // state = next state
            else if (mode == HALF) 
                state = FSM_half[state].next[direction]; // state = next state      

            Stepper_pinOut(state, mode);
                  delay_ms(step_delay);
            myStepper._step_num--; 
        }
    }
}
```
